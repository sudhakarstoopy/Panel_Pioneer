# Panel Pioneer Architecture

## Overview

Panel Pioneer is built using a modern, scalable architecture that leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide an efficient job matching and interview scheduling platform.

## System Components

1. **Frontend**
   - React.js based single-page application
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
   - State management using React Hooks

2. **Backend**
   - Flask-based RESTful API
   - BERT model for resume analysis and job matching
   - Integration with external job portals (LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed)
   - Outlook Calendar API integration for interview scheduling

3. **Database**
   - PostgreSQL for storing user profiles, job listings, and application statuses
   - Redis for caching and improving response times

4. **Machine Learning Pipeline**
   - BERT model fine-tuned on job descriptions and resumes
   - Sklearn for feature engineering and additional ML tasks

5. **External Integrations**
   - OAuth2 for authentication with job portals and Outlook
   - WebSockets for real-time notifications

## Data Flow

1. User uploads resume
2. BERT model analyzes resume and extracts key information
3. Job matching algorithm compares resume data with job listings
4. Matched jobs are presented to the user
5. User selects jobs to apply for
6. System schedules interviews using Outlook Calendar API

## Scalability Considerations

- Containerization using Docker for easy deployment and scaling
- Load balancing using Nginx for handling high traffic
- Asynchronous task processing with Celery for long-running operations

## Security Measures

- HTTPS encryption for all data in transit
- JWT for secure API authentication
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

This architecture ensures that Panel Pioneer can handle a large number of users while providing fast, accurate job matches and seamless interview scheduling.
